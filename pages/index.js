        <h1>What Is Covid?</h1>
        <p>
          Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
          SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will
          experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special
          treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical
          attention.

      <div className="block">
        <h1>How it Spreads</h1>
        <p>
          The virus can spread from an infected personâ€™s mouth or nose in small
          liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.
          These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller
          aerosols.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone
          who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your
          eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in
          crowded settings.
